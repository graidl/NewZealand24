After giving an overview on my research interests and some recent projects, I will focus on two specific works.
The first is about an electric dial-a-ride problem, for which we will discuss a hybrid Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) heuristic featuring an efficient evaluation algorithm for candidate routes, which insert charging stops in best ways on-the-fly. Hereby, we make use of decomposing candidate routes into atomic fragments that can be evaluated in an isolated fashion and cached for later use.
We then also consider how such an LNS can be extended towards the dynamic stochastic scenario.
The second part considers a scheduling problem that is addressed exactly by means of a Logic-Based Benders decomposition. A novel aspect here is that we train a graph neural network on representative instances in order to guide the construction of Benders cuts toward those that are more effective in practice.
