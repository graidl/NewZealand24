Abstract
The machine learning boom of the last years also led to interesting new developments in the area of metaheuristics.
Classical heuristic techniques for approaching hard combinatorial optimization problems are frequently based on construction heuristics, local search but also tree search, sometimes in combination with (mixed integer) linear programming or constraint programming principles. While end-to-end machine learning approaches are still far from replacing these established techniques in combinatorial optimization, it has been recognized that the latter may benefit from incorporating learning for certain purposes.
One may say the aim is to “learn how to better optimize”. This talk will give an overview on some promising recent developments in this direction. For example for tree search based approaches, variants have been proposed that learn better performing branching and node selection strategies. In beam search, guidance heuristics may be learned that yield better results than leading manually crafted heuristics. Large neighborhood search approaches were proposed in which the construction of the neighborhoods to be applied is learned. Some of these methods rely on imitation or supervised learning where labeled training data or some powerful other method to learn from need to be available. More versatile may be methods based on reinforcement learning principles, on which we will also have a look at.
