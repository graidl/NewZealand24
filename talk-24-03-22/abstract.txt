Advances in Large Neighborhood Search for (Dynamic) Electric Dial-A-Ride Problems

The Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP) is a well-studied vehicle routing problem in which customers need to be picked up from individual locations and brought to their destinations within given time windows. In contrast to classical taxi services, different customers may be jointly transported in the same vehicle for improved route efficiency and reduced costs. The excess time in comparison to a user's most direct route must be kept within limits and is to be minimized besides the overall transportation costs. We in particular consider the autonomous electric variant of the DARP (EADARP) in which battery consumption also needs to be considered and suitable charging stops planned within routes.
(Adaptive) Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a metaheuristic that is frequently applied to vehicle routing problems due to its flexibility and efficacy. We will discuss a novel LNS approach for the EADARP that features a highly efficient evaluation algorithm for candidate routes that inserts charging stops in best ways on-the-fly. Hereby, we make use of decomposing candidate routes into atomic fragments that can be evaluated in an isolated fashion on their first encounter; their properties are then stored for later reuse. Experimental results on benchmark instances from former works indicate that this LNS outperforms earlier approaches significantly, yielding new best solutions in many cases.
We then discuss how such an LNS can be extended towards the dynamic stochastic scenario, in which new customer requests arrive over time and need to be integrated into the current planning by repeated optimization. A machine learning model is used as surrogate function to evaluate candidate routes with expected future requests in mind.
