% abstract = {This thesis develops mathematical programming frameworks to operate electric autonomous vehicles in the context of ride-sharing services. The introduced problem is a novel variant of the Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP), denoted by the electric Autonomous Dial-a-Ride Problem (e-ADARP), and includes battery management and autonomous aspects along with classic dial-a-ride features. The e-ADARP operational frameworks undertaken in this thesis consider static problems, in which demand is assumed to be known in advance, and dynamic problems, in which demand is revealed on-line.The static e-ADARP is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program and solved through a Branch-and-Cut framework, enhanced by problem-specific valid inequalities and lifted inequalities from the literature, as well as purpose-based separation heuristics. Computational experiments are performed on adapted benchmark instances from the DARP literature and on instances based on real data. Results show that the problem-specific valid inequalities are among the most effective and especially useful when battery management aspects are relevant. \%Instances with up to 5 vehicles and 40 requests are solved to optimality.The dynamic e-ADARP is developed through a simulation-based optimization approach, which incorporates a new extension to the family of large neighborhood search (LNS) metaheuristics. The extension considers a machine learning component which exploits historical information to select destroy-repair operators from a pool of competing algorithms, all along the search. Computational experiments are performed on dynamic e-ADARP instances based on real data. Results show that combining machine learning within LNS-based metaheuristics produces a competitive alternative to benchmark methodologies from the literature and in the context of on-line operations.Finally, the e-ADARP is a hardly-constrained problem which is challenged by the addition of autonomous and battery management aspects within the vehicle scheduling algorithm. As such, this thesis proposes a novel scheduling procedure for the e-ADARP, which aims at finding minimal excess-time and battery-feasible schedules for fixed routes. Results on instances based on real data show that the algorithm is able to efficiently return optimal scheduling solutions},

% abstract = {Ride sharing is modifying urban mobility by offering reliable and convenient on-demand door-to-door services at any time. This new buiness model is of great interest in the area of city logistics and transportation engineering, as it creates an alternative between private cars (which are expensive, experience congestion, and are polluting) and public transport (which have ﬁxed times and higher accessibility costs). Given the constant increase in demand, ride-sharing businesses are currently planning to expand their portfolio to include on-demand door-to-door transit by the use of electric Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) ([1],[2]).},

% abstractNote={This paper contributes to the intersection of operations research and machine learning in the context of autonomous ridesharing. In this work, autonomous ridesharing operations are reproduced through an event-based simulation approach and are modeled as a sequence of static subproblems to be optimized. The optimization framework consists of a novel data-driven metaheuristic within a two phase approach. The first phase consists of a greedy insertion heuristic that assigns new online requests to vehicles. The second phase consists of a local-search based metaheuristic that iteratively revisits previously-made vehicle-trip assignments through intra- and inter-vehicle route exchanges. These exchanges are performed by selecting from a pool of destroy-repair operators using a machine learning approach that is trained offline on a large dataset composed of more than one and a half million examples of previously-solved autonomous ridesharing subproblems. Computational results are performed on multiple dynamic instances extracted from real ridesharing data published by Uber Technologies Inc. Results show that the proposed machine learning-based optimization approach outperforms benchmark state-of-the-art data-driven metaheuristics by up to about nine percent, on average. Managerial insights highlight the correlation between selected vehicle routing features and the performance of the metaheuristics in the context of autonomous ridesharing operations.},

The scheduling heuristic, based on linear programming theory, aims at finding minimal user ride time schedules in polynomial time. The algorithm can either return optimal feasible routes or it can return incorrect infeasibility declarations, on which feasibility can be recovered through a specifically-designed heuristic. The algorithm is furthermore supplemented by a battery management algorithm that can be used to determine charging decisions for electric and autonomous vehicle fleets. Timing solutions from the proposed scheduling algorithm are obtained on millions of routes extracted from DARP and e-ADARP benchmark instances. They are compared to those obtained from a linear program, as well as to popular scheduling procedures from the DARP literature. Results show that the proposed procedure outperforms state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms, both in terms of compute-efficiency and solution quality.},

% abstractNote={The electric autonomous dial-a-ride problem (E-ADARP) represents a challenging and practically relevant extension of the dial-a-ride problem, which takes electric vehicle charging into account. It introduces battery constraints and the option to recharge vehicles at different charging stations. The present paper proposes a bilevel large neighborhood search approach (BI-LNS) for the E-ADARP. In the outer level of the proposed approach, charging sessions are inserted in the routes of vehicles and in the inner level, the pick-up and drop-off locations of the requests are inserted. In numerical experiments, it is shown that BI-LNS is able to outperform existing approaches on a number of common E-ADARP benchmark instances. Furthermore, the scalability of BI-LNS is evaluated on a set of large problem instances. The results show that the proposed approach is able to find feasible solutions within five minutes for problem instances with up to a few thousand transportation requests.},

% abstractNote={This paper investigates the Electric Autonomous Dial-A-Ride Problem (E-ADARP), which consists in designing a set of minimum-cost routes that accommodates all customer requests for a fleet of Electric Autonomous Vehicles (EAVs). Problem-specific features of the E-ADARP include: (i) the employment of EAVs and a partial recharging policy; (ii) the weighted-sum objective function that minimizes the total travel time and the total excess user ride time. In this work, we propose a Deterministic Annealing (DA) algorithm and provide the first heuristic results for the static E-ADARP. Partial recharging (i) is handled by an exact route evaluation scheme of linear time complexity. To tackle (ii), we propose a new method that allows effective computations of minimum excess user ride time by introducing a fragment-based representation of paths. These two methods compose an exact and efficient optimization of excess user ride time for a generated E-ADARP route. To validate the performance of the DA algorithm, we compare our algorithm results to the best-reported Branch-and-Cut (B&C) algorithm results on existing instances. Our algorithm provides 25 new best solutions and 45 equal solutions on 84 existing instances. To test the algorithm performance on larger-sized instances, we establish new instances with up to 8 vehicles and 96 requests, and we provide 19 new solutions for these instances. Our final investigation extends the state-of-the-art model and explores the effect of allowing multiple visits to recharging stations. This relaxation can efficiently improve the solution’s feasibility and quality.},

In addition to capacity and time window constraints, vehicle routes must also satisfy pairing and precedence constraints on pickups and deliveries.

Several families of valid inequalities are introduced to strengthen these two formulations.

The DARP is a route-planning problem where several vehicles must serve a set of customers, each of which has a pickup and delivery location, and includes time window and ride time constraints. We develop “restricted fragments,” which are select segments of routes that can represent any DARP route. We show how to enumerate these restricted fragments and prove results on domination between them. The formulation we propose is solved with a BC algorithm, which includes new valid inequalities specific to our restricted fragment formulation. The algorithm is benchmarked on existing and new instances, solving nine existing instances to optimality for the first time. In comparison with current state-of-the-art methods, run times are reduced between one and two orders of magnitude on large instances.},

% abstractNote={Nowadays, electric vehicles are considered a viable option for goods distribution, especially in urban areas that are heavily burdened by local emissions. The call for environmentally-friendly vehicles has been heard by car manufacturers and they have begun to introduce electric commercial vehicles, suitable for logistics tasks, into the market. This trend has also motivated the development of algorithms to plan delivery routes that take the characteristics of electric vehicles into account. In the literature, problems have been studied that consider the distribution of goods with electric vehicles from a central depot. However, many real-world applications have a pickup and delivery structure. In these applications, one needs to plan routes in order to satisfy requests; each request requires that a commodity is transported from a pickup to a delivery location. Here, we study the pickup and delivery problem with time windows and electric vehicles (PDPTW-EV). In the PDPTW-EV, access to locations is restricted by time windows. Electric vehicles, that are constrained by capacities for energy and commodities, serve the routes. Energy can be recharged when stopping at dedicated stations. We develop a granular tabu search (GTS) with a policy to determine the amount of energy recharged. In numerical studies, we validate our approach on small-sized instances, and compare it to the results obtained with a commercial solver. On larger-sized instances, we demonstrate that GTS can handle the partial recharging strategy by comparing it to full recharging. Finally, we show that our algorithm is competitive on benchmark instances of the pickup and delivery problem with time windows.},

% abstractNote={We present a large neighborhood search (LNS) as optimization core for a cooperative optimization approach (COA) to optimize locations of service points for mobility applications. COA is an iterative interactive algorithm in which potential customers can express preferences during the optimization. A machine learning component processes the feedback obtained from the customers. The learned information is then used in an optimization component to generate an optimized solution. The LNS replaces a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that has been used as optimization core so far. A particular challenge for developing the LNS is that a fast way for evaluating the non-trivial objective function for candidate solutions is needed. To this end, we propose an evaluation graph, making an efficient incremental calculation of the objective value of a modified solution possible. We evaluate the LNS on artificial instances as well as instances derived from real-world data and compare its performance to the previously developed MILP. Results show that the LNS as optimization core scales significantly better to larger instances while still being able to obtain solutions close to optimality.},

This paper investigates the operational effects of horizontal cooperation among dial-a-ride providers. The current practice is that users choose a particular provider to submit their requests. Providers operating in the same area create their routing solutions independently of each other, given their own set of customers. In contrast, horizontal cooperation through joint route planning implies that customer requests can be exchanged among providers in order to minimize the overall routing cost. In addition to quantifying the operational benefits generated by such a horizontal cooperation, this paper identifies operational characteristics that influence the magnitude of the savings. A real-life case study reveals the reasons why providers benefit from certain request exchanges, as well as the extent to which these exchanges are predictable in advance. The solutions are obtained using a large neighborhood search algorithm that performs well on benchmark data.},

% abstract = {Dial-a-ride services provide disabled and elderly people with a personalized mode of transportation to preserve their mobility. Typically, several users with different pickup and dropoff locations are transported on a vehicle simultaneously. The focus in dial-a-ride problems (DARPs) is mainly on minimizing routing cost. Service quality has been taken into account in the models by imposing time windows and limiting the maximum ride time of each user. We extend the classical DARP by an additional feature of service quality referred to as driver consistency. Customers of dial-a-ride services are often sensitive to changes in their daily routine. This aspect includes the person who is providing the transportation service, i.e., the driver of the vehicle. Our problem, called the driver consistent dial-a-ride problem (DC-DARP), considers driver consistency by bounding the maximum number of different drivers that transport a user over a multi-period planning horizon. We propose different formulations of the problem and examine their efficiency when applied in a Branch-and-Cut fashion. Additionally, we develop a large neighborhood search algorithm that generates near-optimal solutions in a short amount of time. Over 1000 instances are generated with close reference to real world scenarios. Extensive computational experiments are conducted in order to assess the quality of the solution approaches and to provide insights into the new problem. Results reveal that the cost of offering driver consistency varies greatly in magnitude. Depending on the instance, the cost of assigning one driver to each user can be up to 27.98\% higher compared to a low-cost solution. However, routing cost increases by not more than 5.80\% if users are transported by at least two drivers.},

Recently, several extensions have been proposed towards more realistic applications of the problem. In this paper, a new variant called the Multi-Depot Multi-Trip Heterogeneous Dial-a-Ride Problem (MD-MT-HDARP) is considered. A mathematical programming formulation and three metaheuristics are proposed: an improved Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS), Hybrid Bees Algorithm with Simulated Annealing (BA-SA), and Hybrid Bees Algorithm with Deterministic Annealing (BA-DA).

% abstract = { The pickup and delivery problem with time windows is the problem of serving a number of transportation requests using a limited amount of vehicles. Each request involves moving a number of goods from a pickup location to a delivery location. Our task is to construct routes that visit all locations such that corresponding pickups and deliveries are placed on the same route, and such that a pickup is performed before the corresponding delivery. The routes must also satisfy time window and capacity constraints. This paper presents a heuristic for the problem based on an extension of the large neighborhood search heuristic previously suggested for solving the vehicle routing problem with time windows. The proposed heuristic is composed of a number of competing subheuristics that are used with a frequency corresponding to their historic performance. This general framework is denoted adaptive large neighborhood search. The heuristic is tested on more than 350 benchmark instances with up to 500 requests. It is able to improve the best known solutions from the literature for more than 50\% of the problems. The computational experiments indicate that it is advantageous to use several competing subheuristics instead of just one. We believe that the proposed heuristic is very robust and is able to adapt to various instance characteristics. }

% abstract = {The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (EVRPTW) is an extension to the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) where the fleet consists of electric vehicles (EVs). Since EVs have limited driving range due to their battery capacities they may need to visit recharging stations while servicing the customers along their route. The recharging may take place at any battery level and after the recharging the battery is assumed to be full. In this paper, we relax the full recharge restriction and allow partial recharging (EVRPTW-PR), which is more practical in the real world due to shorter recharging duration. We formulate this problem as a 0-1 mixed integer linear program and develop an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm to solve it efficiently. We apply several removal and insertion mechanisms by selecting them dynamically and adaptively based on their past performances, including new mechanisms specifically designed for EVRPTW and EVRPTW-PR. These new mechanisms include the removal of the stations independently or along with the preceding or succeeding customers and the insertion of the stations with determining the charge amount based on the recharging decisions. We test the performance of ALNS by using benchmark instances from the recent literature. The computational results show that the proposed method is effective in finding high quality solutions and the partial recharging option may significantly improve the routing decisions.},

Existing implementations of EVRP duplicate charging station nodes which enables the modelling of EVRP using extended VRP formulations. Two limitations of such an approach are: (i) the number of such duplications is not known a priori, and (ii) the size of the problem increases. In our formulation, we allow multiple visits to a charging station without duplicating nodes. We propose five new operators for ALNS which are tested on 120 instances each of E-VRP-NL and E-VRP-NL-LD, and 80 instances of E-VRP-NL-LD-CCS. Results show that our ALNS outperforms the existing algorithms improving the solution in 63% of the instances and matching the best known solution in 31% of the instances. Results also show that considering load-dependent discharge is critical to optimally solve E-VRP.},

% abstractNote={Effective route planning for battery electric commercial vehicle (ECV) fleets has to take into account their limited autonomy and the possibility of visiting recharging stations during the course of a route. In this paper, we consider four variants of the electric vehicle-routing problem with time windows: (i) at most a single recharge per route is allowed, and batteries are fully recharged on visit of a recharging station; (ii) multiple recharges per route, full recharges only; (iii) at most a single recharge per route, and partial battery recharges are possible; and (iv) multiple, partial recharges. For each variant, we present exact branch-price-and-cut algorithms that rely on customized monodirectional and bidirectional labeling algorithms for generating feasible vehicle routes. In computational studies, we find that all four variants are solvable for instances with up to 100 customers and 21 recharging stations. This success can be attributed to the tailored resource extension functions (REFs) that enable efficient labeling with constant time feasibility checking and strong dominance rules, even if these REFs are intricate and rather elaborate to derive. The studies also highlight the superiority of the bidirectional labeling algorithms compared to the monodirectional ones. Finally, we find that allowing multiple as well as partial recharges both help to reduce routing costs and the number of employed vehicles in comparison to the variants with single and with full recharges.},

Given the fact that people are subject to transportation, constraints related to quality of service are usually present, such as time windows and maximum user ride time limits. In many real world applications, different types of users exist. In the field of patient and disabled people transportation, up to four different transportation modes can be distinguished. In this article we consider staff seats, patient seats, stretchers and wheelchair places. Furthermore, most companies involved in the transportation of the disabled or ill dispose of different types of vehicles. We introduce both aspects into state-of-the-art formulations and branch-and-cut algorithms for the standard dial-a-ride problem. Also a recent metaheuristic method is adapted to this new problem. In addition, a further service quality related issue is analyzed: vehicle waiting time with passengers aboard. Instances with up to 40 requests are solved to optimality. High quality solutions are obtained with the heuristic method.},

% abstract = {Dial-a-ride problems are concerned with the design of efficient vehicle routes for transporting individual persons from specific origin to specific destination locations. In real-life this operational planning problem is often complicated by several factors. Users may have special requirements (e.g. to be transported in a wheelchair) while service providers operate a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles from multiple depots in their service area. In this paper, a general dial-a-ride problem in which these three real-life aspects may simultaneously be taken into account is introduced: the Multi-Depot Heterogeneous Dial-A-Ride Problem (MD-H-DARP). Both a three- and two-index formulation are discussed. A branch-and-cut algorithm for the standard dial-a-ride problem is adapted to exactly solve small problem instances of the MD-H-DARP. To be able to solve larger problem instances, a new deterministic annealing meta-heuristic is proposed. Extensive numerical experiments are presented on different sets of benchmark instances for the homogeneous and the heterogeneous single depot dial-a-ride problem. Instances for the MD-H-DARP are introduced as well. The branch-and-cut algorithm provides considerably better results than an existing algorithm which uses a less compact formulation. All seven previously unsolved benchmark instances for the heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem could be solved to optimality within a matter of seconds. While computation times of the exact algorithm increase drastically with problem size, the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm provides near-optimal solutions within limited computation time for all instances. Several best known solutions for unsolved instances are improved and the algorithm clearly outperforms current state-of-the-art heuristics for the homogeneous and heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem, both in terms of solution quality and computation time.},

% abstract = { A dynamic time window relates to two operations that must be executed within a given time meaning that the difference between the points in time when the two operations are performed is bounded from above. The most prevalent context of dynamic time windows is when precedence is given for the two operations so that it is a priori specified that one operation must take place before the other. A prominent vehicle routing problem with dynamic time windows and precedence is the dial-a-ride problem (DARP), where user-specified transportation requests from origin to destination points must be serviced. The paper presents a new branch-and-cut-and-price solution approach for the DARP, the prototypical vehicle-routing problem with ordinary and dynamic time windows. For the first time (to our knowledge), both ordinary and dynamic time windows are handled in the column-generation subproblem. For the solution, an effective column-generation pricing procedure is derived that allows fast shortest-path computations due to new dominance rules. The new approach is compared with alternative column-generation algorithms that handle dynamic time windows either as constraints of the master program or with less effective labeling procedures. Computational experiments indicate the superiority of the new approach. }

% abstract = { This paper presents a mixed-integer programming model for a variant of the pickup and delivery problem with time windows. The fleet is assumed to be heterogeneous with a novel feature that allows the vehicles to be configured before service begins to handle various types of demand. The work was motivated by a daily route planning problem arising at a senior activity center. A fleet of configurable vans is available each day to transport participants to and from the center, as well as to secondary facilities for rehabilitative and medical treatment. The number of participants and support equipment that a van can accommodate depends on how it is configured. An exact method is introduced based on branch and price and cut. At each node in the search tree, the master problem is solved by column generation to find a lower bound. To improve the bound, subset-row inequalities are applied to the variables of the master problem. Columns are generated by solving the pricing subproblems with a labeling algorithm enhanced by new dominance conditions. Local search on the current set of columns is used to quickly find promising additions. Implementation details and ways to improve the performance of the overall procedure are discussed. Testing was done on a set of real instances as well as a set of randomly generated instances with up to 50 customer requests. The results show that optimal solutions are obtained in the majority of cases. }

% abstract = {This paper investigates the Heterogeneous Dial-A-Ride Problem (H-DARP) that consists of determining a vehicle route planning for heterogeneous users’ transportation with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. A hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve the problem. Efficient construction heuristics, crossover operators and local search techniques, specifically tailored to the characteristics of the H-DARP, are provided. The proposed algorithm is tested on 92 benchmarks instances and 40 newly introduced larger instances. Computational experiments show the effectiveness of our approach compared to the current state-of-the-art algorithms for the DARP and H-DARP. When tested on the existing instances, we achieved average gaps of only 0.47\% to the best-known solutions for the DARP, and 0.05\% to the optimal solutions for the H-DARP, compared to 0.85\% and 0.10\%, respectively, obtained by the current state-of-the-art algorithms. For the 40 newly generated instances, average gaps of the hybrid GA are 0.35\% smaller compared to the current state-of-the-art method. Besides, our method provides best results for 31 of these instances and ties with the existing method on 8 other instances.},

% abstract = {The Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) consists of designing vehicle routes and schedules for customers with special needs and/or disabilities. The DARP with Electric Vehicles and battery swapping stations (DARP-EV) concerns scheduling a fleet of EVs to serve a set of pre-specified transport requests during a certain planning horizon. In addition, EVs can be recharged by swapping their batteries with charged ones from any battery-swap stations. We propose three enhanced Evolutionary Variable Neighborhood Search (EVO-VNS) algorithms to solve the DARP-EV. Extensive computational experiments highlight the relevance of the problem and confirm the efficiency of the proposed EVO-VNS algorithms in producing high quality solutions.},

% abstractNote={This paper considers a generalization of a bi-objective dial-a-ride problem, incorporating real-life characteristics of patient transportation. It studies the impact of combination restrictions, preventing particular user combinations and limiting the set of drivers to which particular users can be assigned. The academic literature currently lacks insights into the effect of these restrictions on the cost structure of a service provider. A multi-directional local search algorithm is developed to solve this problem, taking into account the fundamental tradeoff between operational efficiency and service quality. Local search is integrated into a variable neighborhood descent framework that applies an intelligent candidate list principle to reduce computation time. Moreover, a new scheduling procedure is proposed, constructing time schedules that minimize total user ride time. It proves to be faster and more efficient than existing scheduling procedures. Overall, computational experiments on existing benchmark data extended with combination restrictions reveal a general pattern in the effect of the combination restrictions. Such insights are essential for service providers in order to support policy choices, e.g. related to service quality or medical education of drivers.},

% abstractNote={We consider a static decision model related to the management of a Dial-a-Ride (DAR) system involving small autonomous electrical vehicles in a closed industrial site. Because of the specific features of the system, in this paper we concentrate on its reliability and propose a model that aims at assigning requests to vehicles by minimizing the number of loading/unloading operations. We propose an integer linear programming formulation of such Stop Number Minimization Problem and examine the behavior of some of its variants. Next, we consider and analyze a set covering oriented reformulation of the model. Finally, we propose a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) based heuristic approach that implements insertion mechanisms and is well fitted to realistic dynamic contexts. All proposed methods are tested on benchmark instances involving some tens of requests.},

% abstract = {In the dial-a-ride problem, user-specified transport requests from origin to destination points have to be served by a fleet of homogeneous vehicles. The problem variant we consider aims at finding a set of minimum-cost routes satisfying constraints on vehicle capacity, time windows, maximum route duration, and maximum user ride times. We propose an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) for its solution. The key novelty of the approach is an exact amortized constant-time algorithm for evaluating the feasibility of request insertions in the repair steps of the ALNS. In addition, we use two optional improvement techniques: a local-search-based intraroute improvement of routes of promising solutions using the Balas-Simonetti neighborhood and the solution of a set covering model over a subset of all routes generated during the search. With these techniques, the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of solution quality. New best solutions are found for several benchmark instances.

% abstractNote={The organization of a specialized transportation system to perform transports for elderly and handicapped people is usually modeled as dial-a-ride problem. Users place transportation requests with specified pickup and delivery locations and times. The requests have to be completed under user inconvenience considerations by a specified fleet of vehicles. In the dial-a-ride problem, the aim is to minimize the total travel times respecting the given time windows, the maximum user ride times, and the vehicle restrictions. This paper introduces a dynamic programming algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem and demonstrates its effective application in (hybrid) metaheuristic approaches. Compared to most of the works presented in literature, this approach does not make use of any (commercial) solver. We present an exact dynamic programming algorithm and a dynamic programming based metaheuristic, which restricts the considered solution space. Then, we propose a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm which integrates the dynamic programming based algorithms into a large neighborhood framework. The algorithms are tested on a given set of benchmark instances from the literature and compared to a state-of-the-art hybrid large neighborhood search approach.},

% abstract = {Technology is changing the way we move and reshaping cities and society. Shared and on-demand mobility represent notable transportation shifts in the 21st century. In recent years, mobility on demand (MOD)—where consumers access mobility, goods, and services on-demand by dispatching shared modes, courier services, public transport, and other innovative strategies—has grown rapidly due to technological advancements; changing consumer preferences; and a range of economic, environmental, and social factors. New attitudes toward sharing, MOD, and mobility as a service (MaaS) are changing traveler behavior and creating new opportunities and challenges for public transportation. This chapter discusses similarities and differences between the evolving concepts of MaaS and MOD. Next, it characterizes the range of existing public transit and MOD service models and enabling partnerships. The chapter also explores emerging trends impacting public transportation. While vehicle automation could result in greater public transit competition in the future, it could also foster new opportunities for transit enhancements (e.g., microtransit services, first- and last-mile connections, reduced operating costs). The chapter concludes with a discussion of how MOD/MaaS partnerships and automation could enable the public transit industry to reinvent itself, making it more attractive and competitive with private vehicle ownership and use.}
